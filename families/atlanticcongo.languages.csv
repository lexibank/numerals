The number one always behaves like a descriptive adjective; the numerals 2-9 are indeclinable. Any of these might be added to the numbers 20, 30, 40 and 60, with e.g. 79 becoming 60 +10 + 9. 80 and numbers up to 400 and beyond all involved both multiplication and addition always using 20 or 400 as the basic e. g. 119 was 5 times 20 + 10+ 9; 519 was 400 + 5 times 20 plus ten plus 9. The system is now in the process of being changed to multiples of 10, 100, 1000 which of course suits the modern world much better. The notation will need to be reinterpreted first into the Abuan orthography, then into IPA. The symbol [ before b, d, a, e, i, o, u means that each of these letters has a subscript dot in the orthography; this subscript dot is an implosive marker in the case of the consonants and a concord marker in the case of the vowels. A dotted vowel in the orthography indicates that all preceding vowels in the word are also dotted (lax vowels). Absence of subscript dot under a vowel means that that vowel is a tense vowel.

A Descriptive Grammar of the Dòmpò Language of Ghana, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia, April 2020.","decimal AND vigesimal","","Other comments: Dompo is a moribund language spoken by about six remaining speakers who do not actively speak it amongst themselves. There are a few others who have limited proficiency in the language. It is spoken in Dompofie, a small community located in the North-Western corner of the Bono Region of Ghana, West Africa. Dompo has a vigesimal system. Dompo has the cardinal number system from one to a thousand. The numeral system from one to ten is made up of single morphemes while the subsequent numbers are compounded. The language uses the decimal base 10 numbering system in counting. This is largely because speakers use their fingers to count in quantities. It also employs the vigesimal or base 20 numbering system for the numbers forty, sixty and eighty in the language. It was observed that the youngest consultant uses nàí for the number four and nùí for five while the oldest consultant uses nám and nùm for four and five respectively. I also noticed subsequently that they both sometimes interchange the words unconsciously. Additionally, when counting the numbers individually. The numbers which follow, eleven to nineteen, are formed by adding the numbers kòó ‘one’, nyɔ̃̀ɔ̃́ two’, etc. to the decimal number ten with the decimal number preceding the cardinal number. Observe, however, that the last /o/ in kòó and /ɔ/ in nyɔ̃̀ɔ̃́ are lost when the form they occur in comes after the decimal. The number twenty is made up of a single morpheme dìɔ̃̀. Twenty-one to thirty are connected with the conjunction nɛ́ ‘and’ which occurs between them. We would also observe the addition of a suffix -lè, whose meaning has not been established, to kòó as seen in the number twenty-one. The numbers forty, sixty, eighty are derived when twenty is multiplied by two, three and four respectively. The numbers fifty, seventy and ninety are derived by adding krí ‘ten’ to the numbers forty, sixty and eighty. This is further compounded using the conjunction nɛ́ ‘and’. làfà, meaning ‘hundred’ in Dompo, is introduced in the counting system. Basic tones in Dompoː The basic contrastive level tones in Dompo are represented by the tonal markers (ˊ) for high tone and (ˋ) for low tone. Generally, there are more syllables with low tone in Dompo than high tones. The rising and falling contour tones, which are not common in the tonal system of the language. Tones on monosyllabic words can either be high (H) or low (L).",""

Àbà is derived from iba ‘two’ ata from ita ‘three’ and ánáñ from ínáñ ‘four’. The replacement of the initial vowels of these elements from /i/ - /a/ implies the doubling of the units which are then multiplied by 10 to achieve the derivation.

In the previous version I put a hyphen between prefixes and roots to distinguish them. Since this precision does not seem to be important for your presentation, I have taken it out. Borrowing: etemel ‘100’ could be a loan from Wolof (tɛːmɛːr cf. your section in Wolof) thus, coming from money counting. It could also be a common root since the languages are related i.e. they are all Atlantic. Historical evidence is required to give a definite answer to this. ekkeme ‘100’ is definitely a recent loan from Mandinka but through Jóola Fónyi following the Islamization of the Jóola Fonyi. The vast majority of native speakers, including myself, have been taught to say and do say etemel ‘100’. ekkeme ‘100’ is more often used by Muslims for whom Mandinka has a lot of prestige. How integrated it is in the language can be a matter of debate. fɷtɔx ‘five’ is not related to ‘to be sufficient’ which is ɛttɔx as argued in the Bandial data. The second root has a geminate consonant. So here we have a minimal pair between tɔx ‘five’ and ttɔx ‘to be sufficient’. For euli ‘1000’, I can see in your data that the root is shared with a couple of related languages. It could be a loanword from Mandinka/ Pulaar. But it could also be a shared root.

September 4, 2013.","vigesimal","","Igala has vigesimal numeral system. There are separate units for the numerals ‘zero’ to ‘ten’ in Igala. There are also other separate forms for higher units; óɡʷú for ‘twenty’, ódʒe for ‘fifty’, ɔ̀ɡbʷá ɔ́kɔ́ for ‘two hundred’ úlú (ɔ́kɔ́) for ‘four hundred’, óɡwúmétʃi for ‘seven hundred’, and the highest unit is ítʃámû ‘eight hundred’ in this hierarchy. The units for ‘two hundred’ and ‘four hundred’ may occur with an optional expression, ɔ́kɔ́‘money’. This may be a pointer to the fact that these units came into the numeral system with the invention of money in Igala economy at some. Other units in the numeral system are the morpheme òké ‘unit’, the overt addition morpheme, ɲú, the multiplication morpheme, mɔ́ and the subtraction morpheme, tʃì. For addition in the numeral system, the lower base numerals, particularly ‘one’ to ‘ten’, are used for counting the additions up to ‘nineteen’ in phrase combination with whatever is added. After these juxtapositions, there is the new unit, ógʷú for ‘twenty’. Observe above that there is a special form for ‘one’ in the combination meaning ‘eleven (ten plus one)’, using the alternate/clitic form, kâ instead of the fully-fledged ǒkâ morpheme. This alternate form also occurs everywhere else where the sum of addition brings the number to ‘plus one’ in the numeral system. Observe from the set of examples that beyond ‘twenty’, in the addition of ‘one’, a new morpheme, ɲú (lit. enter) ‘add’ is attached obligatorily before the added value. In counting ‘plus one’ in the thousandth, the morpheme, òké ‘unit’ makes ‘one’ an optional expression, as the sense of ‘unit’ may stand at this rate to also express ‘plus one’, as is shown in ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké (mɔ̂ kâ) ‘one thousand and one’. The addition template, ɲú ((òké) mɔ́, is utilized generally in the higher numerals from ‘twenty’ in adding forms of the lower numerals generally. For numeral values lower than ‘thousand’; from ‘twenty’ upwards, even though the expression òké ‘unit’ may be utilized, it is phonologically optional as is shown using the brackets in the numeral examples. The simple additive morpheme, ɲú may also be used in isolation for addition. This is the case in instances such as ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ mɔ́ ɲú ódʒe (lit. two hundred add fifty), ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷɔ̀ mɔ́ ɛ̀lú (lit. eight hundred add one hundred) ‘eight hundred’ and ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ (lit. eight hundred add two hundred) ‘one thousand’. Whereas in phrasal combinations for simple additions of the lower numerals, ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’, the structural means is generally by the juxtaposition of ‘ten’, the highest unit of the base numerals that can be paired with other units below it; juxtaposition for the purpose of addition in the higher numerals is restricted only to the two isolates in the system, óɡʷú ɛ̀ɡʷá (twenty + ten) ‘thirty’ and úlú ɔ̀ɡʷá (four hundred + two hundred) ‘six hundred’. The hierarchy of occurrence is generally from a bigger number to a lower one without exception. Thus, the forms * ɔ̀ɡʷá úlú (two hundred + four hundred), * ɛ̀ɡʷá óɡʷú (ten + twenty) and maybe *ɛ̀ta ɛ̀ɡʷa (three + ten) are deviant structures for addition. ɛ̀ta ɛ̀ɡʷá ‘sixty’ however occurs, but as the sum shows, this case is rather for multiplication, and the ɛ̀ta form here is actually a shortened form for the underlying ɔ̀ɡbɔ̀ mɔ́ ɛta ɛ̀ɡʷá (twenty multiply three x ten) rather than simply *ɛ̀ta ɛ̀ɡʷa(three + ten), which is deviant. One other interesting fact of the Igala numeral system is revealed in the hierarchical organization of its metric system. It seems clear from the occurrence in the language of òké ‘unit’ between higher numerals and numerals between ‘one’ and ‘ninteen’ that numerals ‘one’ to ‘nineteen’ are considered mere units of the lower numerals to be added to higher numerals. This system would contrast with languages like English in which the units are ‘one’ through ‘nine’ only. Observe the following examples, 1001 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké (mɔ́ kâ) 1002 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ èdʒì 1010 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ ɛ̀ɡʷá 1019 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ ɛ̀ɡʷá ɛ̀lá 1020 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ óɡʷú 1050 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ ódʒe As the ungrammaticality of the treatment of ‘twenty’ and ‘fifty’ as units in ‘one thousand and twenty’ and ‘one thousand and thirty’ suggests, these are not lower units in Igala, even though nineteen in ‘one thousand and nineteen’ is demonstrated to be considered a unit. Thus for English it may be ‘units’, ‘tens’, ‘hundreds’, ‘thousands’, etc, for Igala it is ‘units’, ‘twenties’, ‘fifties’, ‘two hundreds’, ‘four hundreds’ and ‘eight hundreds’.",""

PhD-thesis (INALCO), Paris.","vigesimal","","Kam has a vigesimal system with special formation for number 7 . Kam (glottocode: kamm1249) is a language spoken in some 27 villages, in Bali Local Government Area, Taraba State, Nigeria. The biggest Kam village is Mayo Kam. My estimate (based on interviews with 16 village heads) is that there are currently (May 2017) somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 Kam speakers. The name Kam is an exonym of unknown origin. Speakers call themselves and their language Nyiwom (pronounced [ɲĩ́ w̃ɔ̃̀m], and in English spelled as Nyingwom), meaning 'Kam people'. The language is still very much alive, especially in the more remote villages, but most aspects of traditional culture, (including, for example, traditional stories), are now rarely performed and are no longer transferred to future generations. Since Greenberg (1963), Kam has been classified as an Adamawa language, but its relationship with the Adamawa group and other surrounding languages has not been studied in detail and requires much more scrutiny. Notes: 1. For number one, bīmbīnī and bĩ̄ is interchangeable. 2. For eleven, ɡūn comes from àɡún and is a noun; à is usually dropped if àɡún does not occur in isolation. 3. For 20, àkpɔ̃́ doesn't occur anywhere in isolation, only in numerals expressing in numbers divisibly by twenty.

Numbers higher than 10 are formed by ten(s) + unit(s) joined by na ‘and’. Thus, numbers 11 to 19 are as follows: (22) i.kumi na -mu ‘eleven’ i.kumi na mu.kaga ‘sixteen’ i.kumi na -Bili ‘twelve’ i.kumi na mu.saanzu ‘seventeen’ i.kumi na -satu ‘thirteen’ i.kumi na mu.nana ‘eighteen’ i.kumi na -Bina ‘fourteen’ i.kumi na mu.eenda ‘nineteen’ i.kumi na -tano ‘fifteen’ (23) a.iBi.teBe i.kumi na Bi.na A.CL8.chair CL5.ten and CM CL8.four ‘fourteen chairs’ (24) a.in.te i.kumi na i.satu A.CL10.cow CL5.ten and CM CL5.three ‘thirteen cows’ (25) a.ma.ato i.kumi na a.tanu A.CL6.canoe CL5.ten and CM CL6.five ‘fifteen canoes’ Ten in the plural is ma.kumi in class 6. The number of tens is postnominal, following the general ordering of determiners within the NP. Numbers 1–5 are marked for agreement by the concord marker of class 6, namely a-, and the numbers 6–9 in terms of class 3 nouns are simply juxtaposed to ma.kumi, as the formula and the examples in (26) show: (26) CL6.kumi.CM CL6.numbers 1–5 CL6.kumi.CL3.numbers 6–9 ma.kumi a.Bili ‘twenty’ ma.kumi mu.kaga ‘sixty’ ma.kumi a.satu ‘thirty’ ma.kumi mu.saanzu ‘seventy’ ma.kumi a.Bina ‘forty’ ma.kumi mu.nana ‘eighty’ ma.kumi a.tano ‘fifty’ ma.kumi mu.eenda ‘ninety’",""

For those Kisi who accept the use of Nyakyusa numerals, counting beyond ten involves counting multiples of tens for decades and adding single digit numerals to this number. Thus, twenty-five is counted as two tens and five. Swahili numerals are used for the multiples of hundreds and thousands. In counting, class 9 ennumerative agreement is used for ‘one’ and class 10 agreement for ‘two’ through ‘five’. The numeral lilongo ‘ten’ is a class 5/6 noun and so multiples of ten take class 6 agreement. Lilongo appears to be used regularly by the Kisi, but is considered to be Nyakyusa in origin so some Kisi prefer to use Swahili numerals for multiples of ten. Note that Kisi is not a tonal language, rather it is purely a stress language like Nyakyusa. jh in the orthography stands for [ʝ] but this can be pronounced [dʒ] but some, and a very few Kisi will accept [j] as a pronunciation. bh is [β], gh is [ɣ] and lilongo is [liloᵑɡo] though not all Kisi accept the use of lilongo as it is a Nyakyusa loan. They themselves do not seem to have numerals larger than five anymore so people will either use Swahili for everything beyond 5 or Nyakyusa lilongo mixed with Kisi smaller numerals to count multiples of ten. Either way, Swahili is used for numerals 6-9. For 80. themanini, as it is a Swahili loan it isn’t native to either language so it would be pronounced as [θ] following Swahili.",""

Limassa is spoken mainly in Bomassa on the Sangha River in the north of the Republic of the Congo. It is the traditional settlement of the Bomassa, who are accepted as the founders of this village. The village exists since 1920 and was originally called Ngolio (‘eagel’). Today it has ca. 400 inhabitants. The population of the village is multi-ethnic as well as multi-linguistic Further languages spoken in the village are the closely related Ngombe-Baka as well as the Bantu languages Ngundi and Mabenjele-Aka. According to several accounts, speakers may also be located outside Bomassa In the first half of the 20th century some Bomassa founded smaller settlements and fishing camps on the Sangha between Ouesso and Bayanga - Some of these settlements still exist today, e.g. Mombongo, Bounda and Molongodi.

( 2019) I have recently been working on describing Ncane numbers in more detail and today I learned something that might be of interest to you. In our language, as well as many others in our area, the number 20 is m̄bāŋ (or a some cognate). This form is used as the base for forming multiples of 10, but it is for the most part obviously unrelated formally to the number 10. So I was looking at descriptions of other languages in the area to see if they give a plausible explanation of this word. It turns out that Fransen (1995) makes a hypothesis about Limbum 20 that is logical. The Limbum 10 is rvʉ̄ʉ̀ (the form is reported somewhat differently in the more recent observations by Ginny Bradley and Frances Wepnong). This form looks like it could be marked for class 5 (r-). The plural class pairing with class 5 is usually class 6 (m-). So, Fransen suggests (with direction from van Reenen) that 20 is derived from the plural form of 10 plus the number 2 (báā), with the realization of mbáā. The historical form is posited as m-vʉ̄ʉ̀ m-báā (c6-ten c6-two, literally ‘tens two’), and eventually shortened to m-báā ‘twenty’.",""

In fact, it's possible that the fijɛ occuring in the 20's is the word 'thing' as they have the same morphological shape and I've heard reports of similar cases in other Cameroonian languages. The concord marking changes to match the noun when using the numbers with nouns (and is still limited to the digits 1-5 in the one's positions). When used with nouns, the concord also occurs with the single digits 1-5 (eg, fi-ɲi fi-mimia 'one bird', mu-ɲi muɱ-fɛ 'two birds'). -""100"" is intrinsically gender 3/4, which in Nchane has a labialized initial consonant marking singular and presumably 0 marking plural (ie, #Cw 'cl3' and #C 'cl4', eg, gwaŋ 'hill' and gaŋ 'hills'). -""1000"" is intrinsically gender 1/2, which is marked 0-/ba- respectively (eg 0-na 'cow' and ba-na 'cows').

The Mambila ethnic group in present day Taraba State, Nigeria migrated from Central Africa around 3000 BC and eventually settled in a place called Kimi, southern part of Cameroon. After many years of inhabiting Kimi, political (Jihad) and economic crisis rocked the settlement and resulted in a new wave of migration and dispersal. Hence, people groups proceeded under different leaders and settled at various points along the Plateau. The Bang people in the course of these migrations settled in their present day location along the Nigerian-Cameroon border. Owing to war, intruding forces, neighbouring conquerors, land ownership and need for protection, Bang people sought shelter on the Plateau along the remotest part resulting in further fragmentation. Language information Len-Mambila is a variety of the Mambiloid cluster classified as North Bantoid language saddling both sides of the Nigeria-Cameroon border in Taraba State and Adamawa region, respectively. It is spoken by agrarian community in Bang villages, (Bang 3 Corner, Bang Down, Bang Leng, Bang Leng-Lip, Bang Lycop and Saam) of Sarduna Local Government Area, Taraba State; with diminishing number of speakers. It is used alongside Fulfulde and other Mambila lects by most residents. Notesː ‘ŋ̄gàp’ – means calabash. It is indigenously used as a unit of measurement because of the belief that a calabash would hold a hundred kolanut. Moreso, according to one of my consultants, Bang people counted kolanut in hundreds which equates to the amount a calabash can hold. ‘wún’ – means rope. So Bang people refer to 1000 as a rope alluding the tradition of tying a rope to ten calabashes to indicate some kind of bundle.",""

"687","orok1266-1","Oroko, Cameroon","orok1266","Oroko","bdu","Africa",4.89504,9.15209,"Atlantic-Congo","Oroko.htm","Mr. Dan Friesen, Missionary with World Team, USA, June 15, 2009.",NA,"","The data was taken from Mbonge dialect of Oroko language, South West Region of Cameroon, over the last 10 year. Vocabulary notes: 1. The word for 100 is the same word as used for bags. There is likely some historical link between something carried in bags and 100 (coins or weight in pounds/kg), but I have no solid proof of this. 2. The word for 1000 is “sheet of paper” which itself is the same as “wing of bird”. The currency here is CFA, with 1000 being one of the smallest paper bills (currently equivalent to about $2, set exchange with Euro, formerly French Franc, so has remained fairly stable, as in it has probably been one of the smallest paper notes for a long time). I’m not definite on this link, but given that this is an alternative vocabulary item, it seems fairly likely. Of course, more recently the English numerals are replacing the traditional counting system, such as /hundreti/ ‘100’ and /tawsandi/ ‘1000’. Morphology Notes: 1. Just in case you wondered, the series from 31-39 echoes 11-19 in the form of 20+10+1, 20+10+2, 20+10+3, 20+10+4, 20+15, 20+15+1, 20+15+2, 20+15+3, 20+15+4. And just in case you look up Cameroon and notice that it is francophone, don’t assume that they are copying the idea from French 80-99 numbers. The Oroko live in the section of Cameroon that is a former ENGLISH colony. 2. The first word of forty (móˋ) is the same noun as twenty (ɾóˋ), but with a different class marker. Phonologically this breaks down: /ɗi-/ (class 5 - singular) or /ma-/ (class 6 - plural) attaching to the root /óˋ/ (“twenty”) where the vowel of the class marker is deleted. The same is true of one/two hundred (root /kpa/ with class 7 /e/- or 8 /be/- prefix) and also one/two thousand (root /kóɾí/ with class 19 (singular) /i/- or 11 (plural) /ɾo/- prefix). 3. The second word (modifer) of forty (máàbɛ́ / máˋbɛ́) is really the same word as two (béèbɛ́ / béˋbɛ́), being made of the root /ˋbɛ́/ (‘two’) with class 6 (plural) agreement prefix /má/- (to agree with the class of ‘twenty’) or the class 8 (plural) marker /bé/- (default for ordinal counting) respectively. The same is true of the modifiers of thousand, which are the same roots as ‘one’ /ɔ́kɔ́/ and ‘two’ /ˋbɛ́/ except with the appropriate class markers, class 19 (singular) /i/- or 11 (plural) /ɾo/- prefix). 4. The root of ‘one’ is /ɔkɔ/, but when the prefix /i/- is added, a glide /j/ can be heard phonetically between the prefix and root. When the prefix /e/- is added, some dialects have the same /j/ as a glide, while about half the dialects insert /ʧ/, or /e/ becomes /ʧ/ resulting in /eʧɔkɔ/ or /ʧɔkɔ/. This process is generally observed throughout the phonology in the other dialects, but I have not fully analyzed it. Dialect Comments: There are at least 9 distinct Oroko ‘clans’ each with their own dialect, with 4 definite dialect clusters (1-3-1-3) that are approximately equally different from each other and one (forming what I call a ‘dialect circle’ as opposed to a ‘dialect continuum’). The last dialect borders another language and is the most different from everyone, relating more strongly to only 1 cluster. None of the clans or clusters is obviously central, more respected or historically the root of the others. - One of the other 8 Oroko dialects uses 5+3 for ‘8’. About half use a totall separate vocabulary item /wambi/ that may be borrowed from a neighboring language. - Two dialects use 5+4 for ‘9’, others have morphological variants of ‘not 1’. - As for the numbers 10 and above, initial data shows only slight phonetic, phonological or morphological differences. Example: ‘2’ is /bebɛ/, /bebe/, or /beba/ and ‘4’ is /bene/, /benɛi/, /beni/, /bini/ depending on the dialect Oroko phonemic Chart: Consonants Labial Alveolar Laminal 1 Velar Labiovelar Voiceless f t s k kp Voiced b ɾ j w Nasals m n ɲ Prenasals mb nd ɲdʒ ŋɡ ŋmɡb Phonetic Observations: - General observation – with a lack of a stop/fricative distinction at any point of articulation, the consonants (more so in the front of the mouth) all have a bit of variation in the amount/strength of closure, so that sometimes the air is incompletely “stopped”, while not a prototypical fricative. o /f/ varies between /f/ and a fricative /p/ o /R/ varies between /d/, /l/ and /r/, tending to be ‘stronger’ (more like /d/) word initially, before hi vowels and less so morpheme initially. o /b/ also is ‘stronger’ word-initially, and ‘weaker’ (resembling a /w/ or fricative /b/) word-medially. - Oroko has a 7-vowel Bantu system, with ATR distinctions in the mid-vowels: /i/, /e/, /ɛ/, /a/, /ɔ/, /o/, /u/ - Oroko has two tones, high and low, with downstep (indicated in the transcription as a floating low tone). The downstep is approximately 1/3 below the high tone as compared to the low tone. Downstep is only found at morpheme boundaries (most exceptions can be attributed to borrowed words). Theoretically, this indicates a deleted vowel - either historically (such as the disappearance of a final syllable), or morphologically (Oroko prefers a CV syllable template, and often deletes vowels at morpheme boundaries). The two forms given for ‘two’ béèbɛ́ / béˋbɛ́ illustrate either the lengthening of the prefix vowel to carry the low tone, or the floating tone resulting in a downstep. - The most predominant tone process is for high tones to spread one syllable to the right. This does not happen phrase finally (such as words in isolation), or when the following low tone is in turn followed by a high tone. For example ‘15’ (no spread – phrase final) vs. ‘16’ (high tone on second syllable spreads to final syllable of first word) and ‘11’ (high tone spread from last syllable of first word to second word ‘and’ since the syllable following /na/ is also low) vs. ‘12’ (no spread to /nà/ since the word following is once again high) ---------------------------- [1] As this column has a mixture of alveopalatal and palatal phonemes, I have decided to use the less precise phonetic description “laminal” (Kenstowicz 1994:30) to group all the phonemes made with the tongue-blade, as the traditional phonemic features are all too specific for Mbonge.",""

The list above contains the number words which are still commonly considered to be “true Safaliba” and not borrowed, and are still in current use among speakers age 40+ and some of the younger generation depending on individual factors. Some younger speakers who do not use the Gonja words, use the above list but substitute /pee/ ‘ten’ for /kporigo/ (which is obviously an ‘older’ word for ‘ten’) when the words is used in combination with ‘toko’ for the numbers between 20 and 100. Finally, a few additional different words have been reported for some of the smaller numbers (<10), but these are only known by some of the very elderly (age 65+) and are not in current usage. Safaliba has two tones (High and Low), which have both lexical and grammatical functions. Automatic downstep causes high tones following low tones to have a lower pitch than the previous high tone. Sometimes a lowered high tone occurs following a high tone—this is marked by the down-step symbol (IPA [́] as in the word ànáásí 'four', above), but since its pitch is lowered to exactly the same degree as a ordinary high tone with automatic downstep, such tones are analyzed as “downstepped high tones” and not a third (“mid”) tone.

When I tried to do that, it transformed the ṹ into a copy of the preceding consonant. In other words, when I typed ""kōnũ̀kṹwê"" it gave me ""kōnũ̀kkwê"". I don't know why it did this; I've never seen anything like it before. When I highlighted some letters, I obtained the correct form. So the highlighting isn't there to signal anything, just to ensure that the proper form shows. 2) For the number 1, there are two forms. When counting in the abstract, you use ɑ̀ɖé. So ""one, two, three, four..."" would be ɑ̀ɖé, òwê, ɑ̀tɔ̃̂, ɛ̀nɛ̃̂... But if you want to count actual items, for instance ""one car"" or ""one mango"", you'd use ɖókpó. 3) I can give you morpheme-by-morpheme breakdowns of the longer numbers if you want. For example, 27 is ""20 5 and 2"". 4) I'm not sure that there's a good word for 1000. Traditional counting doesn't go that high.

The traditional system is based on 5 and 20, while the modern system is based on 5 and 10 and mostly borrowed from Fulfulde. There are two words for ‘one’, mŏsī and mŏī. Both words are used and the preferred one varies between different Wawa dialects. The stem mŏ- is derived for diminutive -(s)í. ‘One’ is the only number derived for diminutive, while all others are derived for plural. The numerals from ‘2’ to ‘21’ are shown in table. In this table only the Wawa numbers are presented, most of which are not used anymore. Anecdotally, I refused to speak Fulfulde in the village and only used Wawa numbers when speaking to people, which often led to hesitations by my opponents, who had to calculate with their fingers to understand the number I used. The numbers in Wawa are subject to heavy borrowing. The average person would only use the numbers 1-5 in Wawa; ‘10’ is probably borrowed from Vute and the rest from Fulfulde. Whether the number ‘ten’ is a loan or not could not be established certainly. The Vute (Banyo) numeral ‘10’ certainly is homophone (own research) and it was proposed by different Wawa speakers that tʃɔ́ŋ was a borrowing from Vute. However, one old lady (said to be over 100 years old) in Oumyari claimed that bə̆ntə̄ was the ‘real’ and original Wawa word for ‘10’. This could not be confirmed through neither the dialect survey (which was only done by having two informants for each dialect), nor other Mambiloid languages (Connell p.c.). What may have been a formerly used form is tén-téēnbə̄. This could not be confirmed but was come up with at several times by speakers when asked for another word for ‘10’. The Wawa dialect of Mbengedje has a mono-morphemic word for ‘eight’, sát. I have not come across any cognate for the word sát in Oumyari and the other dialects and was very surprised about its existence in Mbengedje Wawa. As the traditional week is 10 days long, it cannot be related to that. The traditional ‘5’ and ‘20’ based system has been replaced by a ‘5’ and ‘10’ based system, as mentioned above. No one, if not forced through elicitation, uses the traditional ‘20’ base ngwɔ́ī ‘head’ in discourse. Younger generations do not even understand the use of ‘head’ in this context. When forced to speak Wawa they would come up with tʃɔ́ŋ tʃɔ́ŋ nărə̄bə̀ (‘ten ten four’) for ‘forty’ instead of ngwɔ́ī bə̀mbə́ (twenty two). Multiples of ’10 and ‘20’ and their combinations The rule is that when two numbers are connected by bá, they are added, while numbers that follow each other without bá are multiplied, except for the lexicalised numbers 6-9. Numbers can be combined without any tone changes. té-bə̀mbə́ ‘seven’ ngwɔ́ī bə̀mbə́ ‘forty’ ngwɔ́ī bá bə̀mbə́ ‘twenty-two’ ngwɔ́ī nărə̄bə̀ bá tʃɔ́ŋ bá té-mŏī ‘ninety-six’ Fulfulde numbers In everyday speech only the numbers ‘1’-‘5’ are Wawa the rest are Fulfulde (and Vute). The numbers in local Fulfulde are given in table. They are spelt according to the official Fulfulde orthography. The local Fulfulde spoken in Oumyari by non-native speakers is different from native Fulfulde speakers, as the Wawa speakers have assimilated the phonology to match Wawa phonology in many aspects, e.g. the replacement of implosive stops by pulmonic egressive geminate stops. Fulfulde has a base 5’ and ‘10’ system. Large numerals The only large numbers found during fieldwork were ‘100’, which is a compound of ‘5’ and ‘20’ and ‘1000’, which literally means ‘until 10’. These numbers are not used anymore, not understood and it often took consultants several days to come up with the number. All big numbers are in general borrowed from Fulfulde. Among composite numbers the original linking particle be (Fulfulde ‘and’) is omitted and replaced by the Wawa equivalent bá. ranscription of tone There are four level tones in Wawa that can also combine to form surface contour tones. The different tones have been numbered 1 (high) to 4 (low). The following diacritics are used to represent tone in the data: Level tones: tone 1: á tone 2: ā tone 3: ă[1] tone 4: à Surface contours: 1-2 a 1-3 á ̆ 1-4 â 2-1 a 2-3 ā ̆ 2-4 a 3-1 ă ́ 3-2 ă ̄ 3-4 ă ̀ 4-1 ǎ 4-2 a 4-3 à ̆ [1] After the discovery of the fourth tone, I made the decision together with my supervisors, to represent the lower-mid tone (3) with the short mark, as I am analysing the tone system in terms of high, higher- and lower-mid and low. Also, the IPA diacritics for extra high/low do not allow any contours. Numerically, there are more contours including tone 1 and 4 than tone 3, and therefore this diacritic is used.",""

There are five vowels and eighteen consonants in Zinza. Graphemes (letters) are shown below, along with the phonemes (sounds) which they represent. Vowels: Graphemes / Phonemesː i / <i>, e /<ɛ>, a / <ɑ>, o / <ɔ>, u / <u > Consonants: b / <β>, ch / <tʃ>, ny / <ɲ>, sh / <ʃ> The letter <d> occurs most often root initially, or prenasalized root medially, but there is one instance of <d> occuring root medially in a seemingly unborrowed word. The velar nasal [ŋ] does not occur in Zinza. <sh> occurs infrequently, but it does appear word initially and medially in seemingly unborrowed words. The letter <r> does not exist phonemically, but it is written in some proper names by tradition. Tones: Surface tone is written using the acute accent mark. Vowels can be marked for either high, rising, or falling tone.2 Low tones are not marked. Graphemes for each type of tone are shown below using a as the example vowel. Note that underlying tones of affixes are not marked throughout this document, since the relevant level of tone marking for orthography purposes is word-level surface tone. á [ɑ́], aá [ɑ̌ː], áa [ɑ̂ː]",""
