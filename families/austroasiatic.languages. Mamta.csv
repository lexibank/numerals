In English, 'one' has different mathematical uses which are disambiguised in Pnaric-War-Lyngngam with *mi and *ʧi. mi is mainly used as cardinal one, ʃi/ʧi is mainly used to count ‘one’ for measure units and to count ‘one’ for powers of ten. For example, in War ʃi phuːa ‘ten’, lit. ‘one-ten’, ʃi swaɁ ‘one hundred’. mi expresses cardinal ‘one’ in ‘one leave’; ʃi swaɁ mi ‘one hundred one’. ʃi/ʧi expresses one in measure units: ʃi khup ‘one breadth-of-four fingers’. ʃi/ʧi is also used as ‘one’ for units of time, e.g. the whole day, one month length. mi ‘one’ to express ‘one o’clock’ contrasts with ʃi to express ‘one hour’ as a unit of time. ʃi/ʧi may also be used for a unit whose cardinal value is not relevant or is undefined as in War ʃi dit ‘a little while’, ʃi kur ‘people from the same clan’, ʃi pero brothers and sisters from the same mother. This is a qualifying use v.s. quantifying use of previous examples. ʃi/ʧi is also used as a kind of aspectual device, as in War: ʃi pam ‘to cut in one blow’ (pam ‘to cut’). Pnar, Khasi and Lyngngam cardinals belong to a Pnaric system which slightly differs from a War one, more conservative from an AA viewpoint. Numerals expressing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 have common roots but 7, 8, 9 and teens are different. In Pnar the loss of /m/ or /b/ in onset position of monosyllabic words is frequent, as in mi > wi (one), ba > wa (dependency marker). This loss is not found in lexical elements in Khasi and Lyngngam. The Khasi and Lyngngam cardinal systems are then derived from the Pnar one.

In English, 'one' has different mathematical uses which are disambiguised in Pnaric-War-Lyngngam with *mi and *ʧi. mi is mainly used as cardinal one, ʃi/ʧi is mainly used to count ‘one’ for measure units and to count ‘one’ for powers of ten. For example, in War ʃi phuːa ‘ten’, lit. ‘one-ten’, ʃi swaɁ ‘one hundred’. mi expresses cardinal ‘one’ in ‘one leave’; ʃi swaɁ mi ‘one hundred one’. ʃi/ʧi expresses one in measure units: ʃi khup ‘one breadth-of-four fingers’. ʃi/ʧi is also used as ‘one’ for units of time, e.g. the whole day, one month length. mi ‘one’ to express ‘one o’clock’ contrasts with ʃi to express ‘one hour’ as a unit of time. ʃi/ʧi may also be used for a unit whose cardinal value is not relevant or is undefined as in War ʃi dit ‘a little while’, ʃi kur ‘people from the same clan’, ʃi pero brothers and sisters from the same mother. This is a qualifying use v.s. quantifying use of previous examples. ʃi/ʧi is also used as a kind of aspectual device, as in War: ʃi pam ‘to cut in one blow’ (pam ‘to cut’). Pnar, Khasi and Lyngngam cardinals belong to a Pnaric system which slightly differs from a War one, more conservative from an AA viewpoint. Numerals expressing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 have common roots but 7, 8, 9 and teens are different. In Pnar the loss of /m/ or /b/ in onset position of monosyllabic words is frequent, as in mi > wi (one), ba > wa (dependency marker). This loss is not found in lexical elements in Khasi and Lyngngam. The Khasi and Lyngngam cardinal systems are then derived from the Pnar one.

October 19, 2011, March 22, 2012.",quaternary AND quinary AND vigesimal,decimal,"Lyngngam has a decimal system. The above data is taken from Langkymma Lyngngam dialect in West Khasi Hills. Lyngngam cardinals belong to a late Pnaric cardinal system which slightly differs from a War one, more conservative from an AA viewpoint. The Pnaric and War composite cardinal systems are analysed in details in the light of very conservative Pnaric-War-Lyngngam (PWL) Austro-Asiatic ''groupings'' systems in Daladier (to appear) '' Grouping is used in the sense of Menninger (1969). The names of these PWL groups are found again with shifts in their cardinal values all over AA languages'' Groupings in this PWL counting system use combinations of groupings in base four, five and twenty. Vestiges of such numeration bases are found in Munda cardinals (see Zide 1978) and in TB cardinals (see Matisoff 1997 and Mazaudon 2010). Vestiges of numeration in base four and five are found in some MK cardinal systems, see Jenner (1976) and MPI (2010). In addition to the Pnar and War cardinal systems, where Khasi and Lyngngam cardinal systems are inherited from the Pnar one,  two main pairs of number classifiers for humans and non humans are used in Pnaric-War-Lyngngam: a pnaric one and a War one. Interestingly Lyngngam seems to have remains of a South Munda one with opposite values. In Pnar and in Khasi ŋut is used for people, təlli for goods and ʤur for pairs of animals. In War -be, -baj is suffixed as a number classifier for people and khlɔn for whatever is not human. They add the idea of being a pair or a triad etc. for the counted elements, which usually denote in context a set of exactly two, or three etc. elements; for example in War:  Ɂũr.be ˀi hun ‘a set of two children, both children’, laj.be ˀi hun ‘the three (of them) children’; Ɂũ khlɔn ˀi kwoj ‘a couple of betel nuts’. In Langkymma Lyngngam, cardinals are suffixed with -re and -de classifiers for non humans from ‘two’ to ‘nine’ as follows: -re for ‘two’, ‘three’, ‘four’, ‘six’, (‘seven’), ‘eight’, ‘nine’ and -də for ‘five’. After ‘nine’, Lyngngam uses Pnar classifiers. Pnaric ŋut is used as a classifier for people and təlləj, from pnaric təlli, is used as a classifier for non humans after nine. Zide (1978:57) shows that in GtaɁ (South Munda), -re and -de are suffixed to cardinals to count people (as opposed to cattle and goods) in the following way: -re/-rwa is added to cardinals three, four, seven, eight, nine, ten and -de/-da to cardinals five and six. The similarity of the use of -de and -re in Lyngngam and in GtaɁ suggests in addition to many other data, a previous common quinary grouping number system. Lyngngam has more common lexical elements with Munda than Pnar, War and Khasi.  There is a switch in Lyngngam in the value of number classifiers -re, -de used to count non humans while -re is used in AA to count humans. *raː is a classifier for people in West Bahnaric languages, see Jacq and Sidwell (2000). -r is still used in Munda and in PWL to denote inhabitants of places as in War ‘people of the rivers’.

The above data is taken from Ralling Pnar, the number six is different from that of Jowai Pnar dialect. miː//ʃi (or wiː// ʧi) represents a contrastive pair. In English, 'one' has different mathematical uses which are disambiguised in Pnaric-War-Lyngngam with *mi and *ʧi. mi is mainly used as cardinal one, ʃi/ʧi is mainly used to count ‘one’ for measure units and to count ‘one’ for powers of ten. For example, in War ʃi phuːa ‘ten’, lit. ‘one-ten’, ʃi swaɁ ‘one hundred’. mi expresses cardinal ‘one’ in ‘one leave’; ʃi swaɁ mi ‘one hundred one’. ʃi/ʧi expresses one in measure units: ʃi khup ‘one breadth-of-four fingers’. ʃi/ʧi is also used as ‘one’ for units of time, e.g. the whole day, one month length. mi ‘one’ to express ‘one o’clock’ contrasts with ʃi to express ‘one hour’ as a unit of time. ʃi/ʧi may also be used for a unit whose cardinal value is not relevant or is undefined as in War ʃi dit ‘a little while’, ʃi kur ‘people from the same clan’, ʃi pero brothers and sisters from the same mother. This is a qualifying use v.s. quantifying use of previous examples. ʃi/ʧi is also used as a kind of aspectual device, as in War: ʃi pam ‘to cut in one blow’ (pam ‘to cut’). Pnar, Khasi and Lyngngam cardinals belong to a Pnaric system which slightly differs from a War one, more conservative from an AA viewpoint. Numerals expressing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 have common roots but 7, 8, 9 and teens are different. In Pnar the loss of /m/ or /b/ in onset position of monosyllabic words is frequent, as in mi > wi (one), ba > wa (dependency marker). This loss is not found in lexical elements in Khasi and Lyngngam. The Khasi and Lyngngam cardinal systems are then derived from the Pnar one.

Numerals for higher numbers, as well as ‘zero’, are Malay loans with phonological adaptations. Notesː 1. My transcription differ from that of Diffloth and Phillips in that I have not included epenthesis vowels. Specifically, this excludes the following vowels in my analysis of the phonology: [ə] in: /ʔmpat/ [ʔəmpat]; /smilaːn/ [səmilaːn]; /spuloh/ [səpuloh]; /sblaːs/ [səblaːs]; /sratoːs/ [səratoːs]; /sribuːʔ/ [səribuːʔ] [u] in: /dwɨːʔ/ [duwɨːʔ] 2. Occasionally, in surface realisations, the final /ʔ/ in the Malay loanword /dwɨːʔ/ 'two' is dropped; i.e., /dwɨːʔ/ → [duwɨː]. This violates the phonotactic rules which state that only heavy (or closed) syllables can occur in word-final positions. (cf. Diffloth 1976, 1977). However, I have chosen to include the final glottal in the table above, as final consonant deletion is not a regular pattern, and the underlying form is analysed to include the final consonant. Dropping of final consonant is only observed in this numeral. 3. The numeral /nanəʔ/ ‘one’ is often shortened to the prefix form /nu-/. Prefixation of other numerals is not recorded. 4. Nouns preceded by a numeral are typically unitised. 5. NB! The use of the Malay term /kusuŋ/ with the meaning 'zero' is rare. More often, it is used with the meaning 'empty' or 'nothing'.
