For numbers over five no consistent number system can be elicited. In the noun phrase, numerical or other quantification takes the first slot in the order of things. Numbers require the presence of qualifiers or classifiers. Classifiers are the counters that are used to define the unit of counting in the domain to which the head noun refers. Classifiers signal the semantic type of noun if it is individuated and therefore, classifiers put the nouns into classes. Classes are purely intuitive and if one knows the meaning of a word, by inference via the taxonomy of things, one can establish the classifier of choice. The properly quantified noun phrase then has the syntax: numeral-classifier (modifiers) noun (suffixes). All numbers over two may take the counter <-ka> (CNT), and numbers over three do so obligatorily. Although this morpheme has no obvious function, it is a productive suffix in the sense that also Nepali loan numerals get the affix.

The multiples of hundred are formed with the core numeral wiam ‘hundred’. Native speakers use the word hazrai for thousand instead of wiam suã. The numeral hazrai is derived from hazar ‘thousand’, a numeral found in most Indo-Aryan languages. Note that we observe that Bugun numerals have three tones high, mid and low. It must be noted that tone in Bugun is disappearing mainly due to the impact of languages like Hindi, Nepali, Assamese and others. Tone variations are hardly noticed in Bugun, Deuri and Nocte due to language contact. As most speakers use Hindi, Assamese or Nepali in their everyday life, they have lost tone in their native languages. Also due to lack of active use of native language they can no longer distinguish tone variation nor can they use them.",""

A Grammar of Hyow, School of Humanities, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 2017.","decimal","","Hyow employs a decimal numeral system for counting things. In fact, the decimal system starts from thirty, where the morpheme gíp is used in the decimal slot. There are two forms for numeral one in Hyow. The unbound numeral hngát originates in the PKC *khat*ʔat*hat. Myanmar variety of Laitu Hyow has the similar form for numeral one. The numeral ák is bound, because it has to be attached to classifiers in order to form a numeral compound, as in hɔ̂ lù-ák (bird CLS-one) 'one bird'. The form of numeral twenty originates in the PTB *(m-) kul (Benedict 1972) or *kul (Matisoff 2003). After the numeral twenty, the form of the numerals take twenty as base until the numeral twenty-nine, as in kúl-gól-hníʔ (twenty-and-two/twenty-two). The morpheme gôl seems to function as a conjunctive morpheme, which means 'add' or 'and'. The conjunctive morpheme gôl possibly originates in PTB *ral (Matisoff 2003), which means 'connect'. From the numeral thirty, Hyow employs a decimal system by adding the old numeral gîp 'ten' with the bases, as in thûng-gíp (three-ten) 'thirty', hlí-gíp (four-ten) 'forty', etc. Though the numeral for three is thûm. Hyow seems to have velarized the final nasal for the numeral thúng-gíp 'thirty' (the numeral three in Khumi, one of the Southern Chin languages, is thung). From thirty-one, the Hyow speakers add the conjunctive morpheme gôl to form the numerals. Hyow is a tonal language with three lexical tones – high level (H), low level (L) and high falling (F). Interestingly, different varieties of Hyow have distinct tonal systems. Kontu Hyow employs two falling tones starting from two different pitch levels, while the western Gungrupara Laitu Hyow employs two rising tones. The Laitu dialect in Myanmar has one convex tone and two falling tones, which are recognized as high, mid and low in the orthography. The convex tone and the falling tones of southern Laitu (Minbya Township, Rakhine State) correspond to the falling tone and the level tones of Gungrupara variety respectively. Hyow is a Southern Chin language with all its varieties spread from the present day Rakhine State on the southwest of modern Myanmar to the Chittagong Hill Tracts (henceforth, CHT) in the southeast of Bangladesh. The exonym of the Hyow is khyang. The varieties of this language are known by different names in Myanmar. The common names are Laitu, Laisaw and Kongtu. An approximate population of 4,000 speakers of two varieties, Laitu (the people who live in the plain or who live in the valley) and Kontu (the people who live in the highland or upper land), are found in three districts of Bangladesh, namely Chittagong, Rangamati and Bandarban. The population of Myanmar varieties is very hard to determine, as there are no extensive studies on these languages. However, one of the language consultants from Myebon (Myanmar) estimates approximately 2,000 families of Laitu living in the Mrauk-U, Minbya and Myebon townships. Moreover, he suggests that there is another variety in the delta area called Sumtu, although an article by Watkins (2013) suggests that the morphosyntax of Sumtu is rather different from other Hyow varieties in Bangladesh. According to SIL (2007), there are 14,000 Sumtu living in Myebon, Minbya and Ann townships in Rakhine State. There are roughly 5,000 Kongtu (the term for the similar people in Bangladesh is Kontu) in the Southern hills, next to the Laitu in Minbya Township. This grammar is principally based on the Laitu Hyow spoken by around 1,200 people who live at Gungrupara in Bandarban of the CHT.",""

Nowadays, many Darma, but not all Darma speakers can count to ten. Some speakers use Hindi numbers ever when they know the Darma numbers.

Also, the number 'forty' has an alternate form that is 'two' and 'twenty'. This alternative form appears to be a remnant of the vigesimal system that D. D. Sharma mentioned before. Contrastive tone is found in Darma, but it is attested in a limited number of words. Whether what I find is an example of tonogenesis or the loss of tone, I cannot definitively say. Based on my experience in the Darma community, I would guess that tone is being lost. The paucity of minimal pairs, the difficulty I had in getting speakers to provide words with tone, along with the fact that younger speakers are generally unable to produce tone distinctions in the few words that I have documented with tone all lead me to believe that tone is being lost. I find that there is a two tone contrast: high versus low. The high tone is marked with an acute The high tone is marked with an acute accent above the vowel [ á ] and low tone is unmarked. In general, speakers are unable to articulate how ‘hand’ la and ‘moon’ lá are different; meaning the concept of tone is not familiar to the community.

Data taken from "" Numerals in Bugun, Deuri and Nocte"" by Madhumita Barbora, Prarthana Acharyya and Trisja Wango, North East Indian Linguistics 7 (NEIL 7), Asia-Pacific Linguistics, Colleagues of Asia and the Pacific, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, 2015.","vigesimal","","Deuri or Deori has a vigecimal numeral system. Deuri has prefixes to form the core numeral and in Deuri the prefix mu- is obligatory and the base numerals take the mu- prefix to form the core numerals in the above table. The cardinal numeral tʃa and za ’one’ in Deuri are variants, native speakers alternately use both the forms. Deuri has a prefix kuwa- which helps in constructing higher digits twenty onwards in the language. In Deuri numbers 11 to 19 is built by addition of the basic numerals 1 to 9 to 10. Unlike Bugun, Deuri does not take a conjunctive marker. The prefix mu- affixes to the numbers built by this process. For instance muduga ‘ten’ combines with muza ‘one’ to build the cardinal ‘eleven’. Deuri numerals above 19 take the prefix kowa-. We have the cardinals 20 to 29. The cardinals from 21t o 29 are instance of addition; where the basic cardinals 1 to 9 add up kuwɑ-tʃɑ ‘twenty’. This basic numeral is derived by multiplication kowa x tʃa ‘20 x 1’. The cardinal ‘twenty’ derived by this process is combined with the basic numerals ‘one’ to ‘nine’ to build the higher digits. In Deuri we have the instance of the base numeral n multiplying x and then y is added to build the higher digit. It is to be noted that to form ‘twenty’ the language uses one of the variants for ‘one’ tʃa. And to form the next higher digit the other variant muza ‘one’ is used. Thus ‘twenty one’ in Deuri is formed by the addition of kowatʃa ‘twenty’ to muza ‘one’; In Deuri the peripheral numerals: three, five, seven and nine suffixes to kuwa- to build the odd multiple numerals. In the derivation of the odd multiples a vowel or a consonant or syllable is dropped from the base numerals. Unlike Dzongkha multiple formation, Deuri odd multiples a derived by division. kuwa- multiplies with the base numeral muwa ‘five’ to give kuwamuwa ‘hundred’. In Table 14, with the dropping of the vowel we have kuwamu ‘fifty’. The same is true for the multiple thirty, kuwaŋda is sixty and kuwada with the drop of the velar nasal /ŋ / becomes ‘thirty’. The phoneme or syllable within parenthesis is obligatorily dropped to build the odd multiples. The odd numerals (30, 50, 70 and 90) are a combination of 20 + the (un-prefixed) base numeral, and that the ‘base numeral’ is disyllabic and one syllable is dropped – the first syllable in some case and the last syllable in others. Why this happens we don’t know and this needs further investigation. Note that Tone variations are hardly noticed in Bugun, Deuri and Nocte due to language contact. As most speakers use Hindi, Assamese or Nepali in their everyday life, they have lost tone in their native languages. Also due to lack of active use of native language they can no longer distinguish tone variation nor can they use them. Note that we observe that Bugun numerals have three tones high, mid and low. It must be noted that tone in Bugun is disappearing mainly due to the impact of languages like Hindi, Nepali, Assamese and others. Deuri cardinals do not show tone. Jacquesson (2005) remarks “tonal opposition is dying in Deuri, it certainly was prosperous although it is difficult to locate chronologically”.",""

The numbers from 'ten' to 'twenty' are unattested. In this denary system, tens ('twenty', 'thirty') are transparent compound numbers, e.g. jʰim-tʰi 'twenty' (lit. 'two-ten', meaning 2 x 10). Though unattested in the data, words for 'forty, fifty, sixty' etc. are expected to be formed regularly, e.g. kum-tʰi fifty. Dura has only reserved the number 'one; from Tibeto-Burman origin. The Indo-Aryan loans are easily sorted out: yāvo ‘one’, duvo, duɖa ‘two’ (the latter evidently reflecting the Nepali classifier for inanimate objects), tiyā ‘three’, jʰārā ‘four’ pā̃c ‘five’ as well as probably cyām ‘six’ and syām ‘seven’. The different Dura forms for ‘two’ are borrowed from the Nepali numerals dui ‘two’ and dui-ʈā ‘two pieces’. Similarly borrowed from Nepali are tiyā < tīn ‘three’, jʰārā < cār ‘four’, pā̃c <pā̃c ‘five’, cyām < cʰa ‘six’ and syām <sāt ‘seven’. The indigenous numbers, provided as they were via Facebook, are fascinating in some respects and warrant further discussion. These numerals are particularly noteworthy for preserving a closed syllable structure, mostly a semantically opaque -m#. Possible cognates for liŋa ‘zero’ can be detected in numerous branches of Tibeto-Burman, e.g Bai liɯ⁴², Hani (Southern Loloish) liŋ³¹, Qiangic (Guiqiong lĩ³³, Pumi lẽ¹³), Tujia leng³ and Black Lahu lɛ³³, all ‘zero’. It is seemingly unattested in Bodic languages surrounding the traditional Dura-speaking area. The numeral nām ‘one’ appears to be truly unique to Dura and does not have any cognates in other languages, future research pending. On the other hand, the prefixed di- is an uncontroversial reflex of what is reconstructed on STEDT as Proto-Tibeto-Burman *tyik ‘one’. This prefix is only attested in Dura temporal adverbs such as di-blā ‘once’ and di-syāra ‘one moment’. kya-u (-u being a nominaliser) is translated into Nepali as euʈā ‘one piece’. Number ‘two’, jʰim, is not relatable to Proto-Tibeto-Burman, Numbers ‘three’ and ‘four’ are again unproblematic from a Proto-Tibeto-Burman perspective, cf. Proto-Tibeto-Burman *g-sum, Tibetan *gsum, Proto-Tamangic ᴮsom, Chepang sum, Limbu sum si and Burmese sùm. Most languages retain a rounded vowel, yet Dura is noteworthy in having an orthographic unrounded central vowel <ā> just like Lisu (Loloish) sa, Bai sã⁵⁵, Modern Chinese sān, rGyalrong kǝ sam and Bahing (Kiranti) sam ne, all ‘three’. For the numeral pim ‘four’ compare Proto-Tibeto-Burman *b-liy~b-lǝy, Tibetan bʑi, Proto-Tamangic ᴮbli, Proto-Tani *pri, Chepang plǝy, Limbu li si, Burmese lè etc. Dura seems to have simplified the cluster and preserves only the bilabial prefix, a feat it apparently shares with Tsangla phi, Newar pe, and all of Western Himalayish, as exemplified in Pattani, Darma, Byangsi, Chaudangsi pi and Kanauri pö. Unfortunately, no full set of inherited numerals is preserved in Kham, which uses Nepali cār ‘four’ instead and does therefore not lend itself to a comparison. The loss of the lateral approximant is unusual in the sense that Dura otherwise allows such consonant clusters. A not wholly dissimilar cluster simplification has occurred in Magar, which has buli with an epenthetic rounded vowel /u/. Perhaps then, the labial prefix reconstructed for this etymon was in fact realised as a minor syllable *bə- given the sesquisyllabic nature of roots postulated for Proto-Tibeto-Burman. kum and mācā ‘five’ (the latter perhaps ‘(one) above four’ composed of mā- ‘up, above, uphill’ and IA cār) are noteworthy given that reflexes of Proto-Tibeto-Burman *-ŋa ‘five’ are found in almost all languages of the family except Dura. Dura kum ‘five’ is likely to be derived from kuru ‘hand’. Such a metonymic use of ‘hand’ for ‘five’ is likewise attested in Kham, compare for instance sohmlo kwi: ‘three hands’ = ‘fifteen’ (Watters 2002: 179). It is indeed quite striking how different some of the Dura numerals are from anything found in adjacent Bodic languages: Potential cognates of him ‘eight’ are found only in far-away Namuyi (Qiangic) hĩ³³, Yi (Northern Loloish) hi⁵⁵, Black Lahu hí and Lisu he⁴¹. tum ‘nine’ is reminiscent of Tibetan dgu, Tshona (East Bodic) tu³¹ ku³¹ and Mongsen Ao thuku104, while potential cognates of tʰim ‘ten’ are known from Dhimal te-, and Nung (Nungic) thi³¹ mɯ³¹. This numeral is probably derived from ‘one’, cf. PTB *tyik ‘one’. In Dura, we encounter two words for ‘hundred’, tʰiŋganā and kātʰerāgo, both containing a numeral tʰi-~tʰe- ‘one’ which is further preceded by the velar prefix *k- in the latter form. While the former suffixed element is not transparent, -rāgo is surely derived from Proto-Tibeto-Burman: PTB *r-gya > *rə-gyā > rā-go ‘hundred’ (also compare Written Tibetan brgya). Both sound changes, the epenthesis after the initial minor syllable *r- and the rounding of word-final ā, are well attested in Dura.",""

Tone Jirel has four contrastive tone patterns. The main domains of tone is the phonological word. This word may consist of one or more syllables or one or more morphemes. It is the realm of a correlation between pitch and contour. In the basic tone pattern, the characteristic pitch level is confined to the initial syllable of the word, while the contour spreads over the whole word. In monosyllabic words the contour is realized as a falling or non-falling glide. In di- and poly-syllabic words the non-falling contour is either level or rising. The other contour is falling. The contrastive tone patterns are marked with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 in superscript at the end of the word in the Roman transcription of Jirel. The two high tones carry numbers 1 and 3, the two low tones the numbers 2 and 4 respectively. Word-initial voiced stops and affricates / b /, / d /, / ḑ /, / j /, / g / occur only with low tone. All other consonants can occur with either high or low tone. Table 1.

August 7, 2013.","vigesimal","","Kaike has a traditional vigesimal system. It presents very interesting linguistic expressions in the derivation of higher numerals from the lower ones. It employs the mixtures of the arithmetic bases and other features such as addition and multiplication in the construction of higher numeral expressions. In this section, we discuss how they are organized semantically and integrated morphologically and syntactically into the grammar of Kaike. Morphological properties: The numerals in Kaike may be morphologically categorized into basic and derived. They are discussed as follows: (a) Basic numerals The basic numerals in Kaike include the linguistic expression of the numbers from 1 to 10, 40, 60, 80 and 100. The basic numerals do not undergo any morphological processes. Following are the examples: ti ‘one’ øhe ‘two’ sum ‘three’ li ‘four’ Na ‘five’ ru ‘six’ ne ‘seven’ ke: ‘eight’ ghu ‘nine’ cyu ‘ten’ Nethəl ‘forty’ pheraNe ‘fifty’ sumthəl ‘sixty’ lithəl ‘eighty’ Nathəl ‘hundred’ (b) Derived numerals Apart from the numerals exemplified, the rest are derived from different arithmetic bases by compounding and other morphological processes. The numerals 11-19 are derived from the base ‘10’ plus some other numeral. The numeral /cyudi / ‘eleven’, for instance, is formed by adding /ti/ ‘one’ to the base /cyu/ ‘ten’. This is simply the compounding process. Following are the examples. /cyu-di / [cyu-ti ] ‘eleven’ /cyo-Ne/ [cyo-Nhe] ‘twelve’ /cyu-sum/ [cyu-sum] ‘thirteen’ /cyu-lli/ [cyu-li] ‘fourteen’ /cyor-Na/ [cyu-Na] ‘fifteen’ /cyu-ru/ [cyu-ru] ‘sixteen’ /cyo-nne/ [cyu-ne] ‘seventeen’ /cyor-ge/ [cyu-ke:] ‘eighteen’ /cyur-gu/ [cyu-ghu] ‘nineteen’ However, there occur a number of morphophonological processes in the derivation of higher numerals assuming the lower numeral as the base. In example, the voiceless alveolar stop /t/ has been changed into voiced alveolar stop in intervocalic position. In example, the aspiration of velar nasal /ŋh/ is deleted in compounding. Insertion of /r/ occurs in (e, h and i). In Kaike, the numerals ‘twenty’ and ‘thirty’ are formed by multiplying the base ‘10’ by two and three, respectively. Following are the examples. /øicyu/ [øi-cyu] ‘twenty’ /suncu/ [sum-cyu] ‘thirty’ In above example, not only bilabial nasal /m/ changes into alveolar nasal /n/, but the segment /y/ from /cyu/ is also deleted. In Kaike, the derivation of the higher numerals ‘forty’, ‘sixty’, ‘eighty’, and ‘hundred’ may be assumed with the base /thəl/. However, Kaike does not any independent value for this ‘base’. There is already an independent compound expression for ‘twenty’ in Kaike. If we may simply posit the value of this base as ‘twenty’, we can derive forty, sixty, eighty, and hundred by multiplying the base by two, three, four and five, respectively. Following are the examples. /øethəl/ [Ne-thəl] ‘forty’ /sumthəl/ [sum-thəl] ‘sixty’ /lithəl/ [li-thəl] ‘eighty’ /Nathəl/ [Nathəl] ‘hundred’ In Kaike, the numeral expressions for the numbers, 21-29, are constructed according to the pattern ... xn + y, i.e. some numeral x (i.e. 2) multiplied by the base (i.e. 10) and (plus) some other numeral (Comrie, 2008). Following are the examples: /øicureti/ [øhe-cyu-re-ti] ‘twenty-one’ /øicureNe/ [øhe-cyu-re-Nhe] ‘twenty-two’ /øicuresum/ [øhe-cyu-re-sum] ‘twenty-three’ /øicureli/ [øhe-cyu-re-li] ‘twenty-four’ /øicureNa/ [øhe-cyu-re-Na] ‘twenty-five’ /øicureru/ [øhe-cyu-re-ru] ‘twenty-six’ /øicurene/ [øhe-cyu-re-ne] ‘twenty-seven’ /øicureke/ [øhe-cyu-re-ke] ‘twenty-eight’ /øicureghu/ [øhe-cyu-re-ghu] ‘twenty-nine’ As in Mandarin, Kaike also follows the decimal system in the derivation of the numerals 21-29. The general structure of numerals in a decimal system is x10 + y. In Kaike, as in Diola-Fogny (Atlantic, Niger-Congo; Senegal) the numerals in (26a) may be expressed as ‘two tens and one’. However, the numeral expressions for the numbers, 31-39, are constructed according to the pattern ... xn+n+y, i.e. some numeral x (i.e. 2) multiplied by the base (i.e. 10) plus the base (i.e.10) plus some other numeral. Following are the examples: /øicurecyudi / [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ti] ‘thirty-one’ /øicurecyoNe/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-Ne] ‘thirty-two’ /øicurecisum/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-sum] ‘thirty-three’ /øicurecyurNa/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-Na] ‘thirty-five’ /øicurecyuru/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ru] ‘thirty-six’ /øicurecyone/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ne] ‘thirty-seven’ /øicurecyorke/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ke] ‘thirty-eight’ /øicurecyurgu/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ghu] ‘thirty-nine’ In Kaike, the above numerals may be expressed as ‘two tens and tens one’. The numeral expressions for the numbers, 41-49, are constructed according to the pattern n and y, i.e., the base (i.e. 40) and some other numeral. Following are the examples: /Nethəlreti/ [Nethəl-re-ti] ‘forty-one’ /NethəlreNe/ [Nethəl-re-Ne] ‘forty-two’ /Nethəlresum/ [Nethəl-re-sum ‘forty-three’ /Nethəlreli/ [Nethəl-re-li] ‘forty-four’ /NethəlreNa/ [Nethəl-re-Na] ‘forty-five’ /Nethəlreru/ [Nethəl-re-ru] ‘forty-six’ /Nethəlrene/ [Nethəl-re-ne] ‘forty-seven’ /Nethəlreke/ [Nethəl-re-ke] ‘forty-eight’ /Nethəlregu/ [Nethəl-re-ghu] ‘forty-nine’ In Kaike, the numerals in above table may be expressed as ‘forties and one’. The numeral expressions for the numbers, 51-59, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 40) and ten plus some other numeral. Following are the examples: Nethəlrecudi [Nethəl-re-cyu-ti] ‘fifty-one’ NethəlrecyoNe [Nethəl-re-cyu-Ne] ‘fifty-two’ Nethəlrecyusum [Nethəl-re-cyu-sum ‘fifty-three’ Nethəlreli [Nethəl-re-cyu-li] ‘fifty-four’ NethəlrecyorNa [Nethəl-re-cyu-Na] ‘fifty-five’ Nethəlrecyuru [Nethəl-re-cyu-ru] ‘fifty-six’ Nethəlrecyone [Nethəl-re-cyu-ne] ‘fifty-seven’ Nethəlreke [Nethəl-re-cyu-ke:] ‘fifty-eight’ Nethəlregu [Nethəl-re-cyu-ghu] ‘fifty-nine’ In Kaike, the numerals in (29a) may be expressed as ‘forties and tens one’. The numeral expressions for the numbers, 61-69, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 40) and some other numeral. Following are the examples: sumthəlreti [sumthəl-re-ti] ‘sixty-one’ sumthəlreNe [sumthəl-re-Ne] ‘sixty-two’ sumthəlresum [sumthəl-re-sum] ‘sixty-three’ sumthəlreli [sumthəl-re-li] ‘sixty-four’ sumthəlreNa [sumthəl-re-Na] ‘sixty-five’ sumthəlreru [sumthəl-re-ru] ‘sixty-six’ sumthəlrene [sumthəl-re-ne] ‘sixty-seven’ sumthəlreke [sumthəl-re-ke] ‘sixty-eight’ sumthəlregu [sumthəl-re-ghu] ‘sixty-nine’ The numeral expressions for the numbers, 71-79, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 60) and ten plus some other numeral. Following are the examples: sumthəlrecyudi [sumthəl-re-cyu-ti] ‘seventy-one’ sumthəlrecyoNe [sumthəl-re-cyu-Ne] ‘seventy-two’ sumthəlrecyosum [sumthəl-re-cyu-sum] ‘seventy-three’ sumthəlrecyoli [sumthəl-re-cyu-li] ‘seventy-four’ sumthəlrecyorNa [sumthəl-re-cyu-Na] ‘seventy-five’ sumthəlrecyuru [sumthəl-re-cyu-ru] ‘seventy-six’ sumthəlrecyone [sumthəl-re-cyu-ne] ‘seventy-seven’ sumthəlrecyorke [sumthəl-re-cyu-ke] ‘seventy-eight’ sumthəlrecyurgu [sumthəl-re-cyu-ghu] ‘seventy-nine’ The numeral expressions for the numbers, 81-89, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 80) and some other numeral. Following are the examples: lithəlreti [lithəl-re-ti] ‘eighty-one’ lithəlreNe [lithəl-re-Ne] ‘eighty-two’ lithəlresum [lithəl-re-sum] ‘eighty-three’ lithəlreli [lithəl-re-li] ‘eighty-four’ lithəlreNa [lithəl-re-Na] ‘eighty-five’ lithəlreru [lithəl-re-ru] ‘eighty-six’ lithəlrene [lithəl-re-ne] ‘eighty-seven’ lithəlreke [lithəl-re-ke] ‘eighty-eight’ lithəlregu [lithəl-re-ghu] ‘eighty-nine’ The numeral expressions for the numbers, 91-99, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 80) and ten plus some other numeral. Following are the examples: lithəlrecyudi [lithəl-re-cyu-ti] ‘ninety-one’ lithəlrecyoNe [lithəl-re-cyu-Ne] ‘ninety-two’ lithəlrecyusum [lithəl-re-cyu-sum] ‘ninety-three’ lithəlrecili [lithəl-re-cyu-li] ‘ninety-four’ lithəlrecyarNa [lithəl-re-cyu-Na] ‘ninety-five’ lithəlrecyaru [lithəl-re-cyu-ru] ‘ninety-six’ lithəlrecyone [lithəl-re-cyu-ne] ‘ninety-seven’ lithəlrecyorke [lithəl-re-cyu-ke] ‘ninety-eight’ lithəlrecyurgu [lithəl-re-cyu-ghu] ‘ninety-nine’ The numerals higher than hundred also follow the compounding system in Kaike. However, in such numerals /kyma/ refers to one hundred. The numeral ‘two hundred ’, for instance, is expressed as hundreds two. However, the numeral ‘two hundred fifty’ is expressed as hundreds two plus fifty. Following are the examples: /kyamapheraNNe/ [kyama-pheraNNe] ‘one hundred fifty’ /kyamaNe/ [kyama-Ne] ‘two hundred’ /kyamaNpheraN/ [kyama-N-pheraN] ‘two hundred fifty’ /kyamasum/ [kyama-sum] ‘three hundred’ /kyamali/ [kyama-li] ‘four hundred’ /kyamaNa/ [kyama-Na] ‘five hundred’ /kyamaru/ [kyama-ru] ‘six hundred’ /kyamane/ [kyama-ne] ‘seven hundred’ /kyamake/ [kyama-ke] ‘eight hundred’ /kyamagu/ [kyama-gu] ‘nine hundred’ [1] Givón (2001:100) does not put ordinals (i.e., ‘first’, ‘second’, ‘third’) within the numerals (i.e., ‘one’, ‘two’, and ‘three’). [2] However, there is a word /thil/ ‘palm’, a body part, in Kaike. Thus, we may surmise that /thəl/ refers to such body part having twenty counting units in total.",""

An anthropologist called Nicholas Allen did work on Thulung in the early 70's, and he too recorded an almost complete loss of the numeral system. As for tones, Allen had found traces of tone in Thulung (it took him years to notice it, and it wasn't consistently applied by all speakers--also, he found that the great majority of the words in the language did not have tone), but I found that any tones there may have been were lost by the time I got there. Tone loss through contact is a documented pattern, and as Nepali has no tone, I think that younger speakers must have decided over time that any differences they heard in the few words older speakers made tone distinctions for were irrelevant... Anyway, I feel confident in saying no tone in current-day Thulung. As for Koyi, there are no earlier records, so who knows, but I didn't see evidence of tone when I was there. I’ve only given you the numerals I elicited, but the patterns seem pretty clear and productive: numerals above 10 simply list the different components making them up, and sɔ appears to be 0. 100 had two variants, as listed (both elicited). 20 also has variants: one, sɔksɔ, I elicited, whereas the other, sɔpusɔ, came up in a story when someone was telling me his age (sɔpu is in fact 2-classifier: oko=1-CL, sɔpu=2-CL, rekwɔ=3-CL, and beyond that the generic classifier is -wɔ; something funny going on with the 20 variant, which begs the question of what that supposedly 0 -sɔ actually is—perhaps some kind of nominal meaning “10 unit”, which would explain the use of the classifier form?) Interesting if you consider the difference between Thulung and Koyi—both communities of about the same sizes, yet Koyi has a productive (and used) numeral system, whereas Thulung has borrowed almost the entire system from Nepali.

But unlike Deuri which retains the mu- prefix, in Nocte the prefix wan- does not affix to itʃʰí ‘ten’ from numbers 14 to 19 instead the vowel i- is dropped when the higher digits are formed by addition. In Nocte the base n is followed by y. The cardinals 11 to 19 where the peripheral itʃʰí ‘ten’ combines with numerals 1 to To build numerals from twenty to twenty nine the prefix ruwok- ‘ten’ multiplies with the base numeral ni ‘two’ to derive the cardinal ruwokni ‘twenty’. Nocte has two variants for ‘ten’ itʃʰí a base numeral and ruwok- a prefix. The base numeral ni ‘two’ multiplies with ruwok- ‘ten’ to form ruwokni ‘twenty’. The derived cardinal then adds up with the core numerals 1 to 9 to build the higher numbers. In Nocte we see the base n multiplies with x and then y is added to build higher numbers. The prefix wan- is dropped for numbers 24 to 29. Note that we observe that Nocte numerals show mid and high tone. Bugun numerals have three tones high, mid and low. It must be noted that tone in Bugun is disappearing mainly due to the impact of languages like Hindi, Nepali, Assamese and others. Tone variations are hardly noticed in Bugun, Deuri and Nocte due to language contact. As most speakers use Hindi, Assamese or Nepali in their everyday life, they have lost tone in their native languages.

Dvrù dialect of Rvwàng, Konglang and Sangnay clans. Originally spoken on the upper Rvmetì (N'mai Hka) river north of Konglangpø and also in Nokmong, Putao District, Kachin State, Myanmar. Data provided by Konglang Zineng in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The phonology of this dialect has not been fully analyzed yet. In general, however, this dialect has a similar phonemic system to Mvtwàng Rvwàng (R. Morse 1962/1963; S. Morse 1988, 1989) and Rvmø̀l Rvwàng (Straub 2016). There are three tones on syllables that do not have stop finals, based on a scale of 5 (highest) to 1 (lowest): High/rising á 35, Mid a 22~221, Low/falling à 42~31. Tone on syllables with final p/t/k or ʔ (the latter considered a tone-register complex) is non-distinctive, usually realized as high or high falling. Tone on minor syllables (Cə) is non-distinctive as well. Occasionally a distinct 55 tone will appear on certain particles, or a low-rising 24~34 tone, often associated with first person verb conjugations. Also, vowel length is distinctive for marking grammatical meaning changes, and when the vowel of a stop-final syllable is lengthened, its tone usually becomes mid-rising 24. Vowels: i, e [e~ɛ], a, u, o [o~ɔ], ə, ɨ. Initial consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, s, z [dz], ts, tʃ, dʒ, m, n, ɲ, ŋ, h [h~x], j, l, r [ɹ~r~ɾ]. Voiceless stops and affricates are aspirated, although this is not indicated in the transcription for brevity's sake. Final consonants: p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, r, j. The diphthongs aj, əj, ɨj, uj, oj and the initial clusters ml, pl, bl, kl, ɡl, pr, br, kr, ɡr, kw, ɡw, hw have been observed. In certain words, aj is followed by a glottal stop (ajʔ), lending strength to the analysis of ʔ as a tone-register complex. In terms of phonological processes, two are observable here: (1) Glottal stop elision: In citation form, 'one' is tiʔ. However, when combined with a following syllable, it loses the glottal stop, as in tisə́n 'ten'. (2) The historical final lateral consonant *l is realized as n as in ti-sə́n < *tiʔ-sə́l 'ten'.

The village is no longer in existence, due to war, and residents have been dispersed since the mid-1960s. Data provided by Mvniq Guq Samuel in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The phonology of this dialect has not been fully analyzed yet. In general, however, this dialect has a similar phonemic system to Mvtwàng Rvwàng (R. Morse 1962/1963; S. Morse 1988, 1989) and Rvmø̀l Rvwàng (Straub 2016). There are three tones on syllables that do not have stop finals, based on a scale of 5 (highest) to 1 (lowest): High /á/ 55~53, Mid /a/ 33, Low /à/ 31~11. Tone on syllables with final p/t/k/ or ʔ (the latter considered a tone-register complex) is non-distinctive, usually realized as high or high falling.

Voiceless stops and affricates are aspirated, although this is not indicated in the transcription for brevity's sake. Final consonants: p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, l, r, j. Diphthongs include /aj, əj, ɨj, uj, oj/. /ɨj/ is usually realized with a slightly longer vowel: [ɨˑj]; /aj/ may be considered an inherently-long-vowel counterpart to /əj/. Clusters observed include: /bl, pr, br, kr, gr/. The cluster /mj/ is found in Burmese loanwords, and the cluster /dw/ in Jinghpaw loanwords. In terms of phonological processes, two are observable here: (1) Palatalization: The initial consonant /n/ becomes /ɲ/ when followed by the vowel /i/, e.g. əní sə́l→əɲí sə́l 'twenty'. Although this nasal palatalization is a regular process, the palatal nasal forms are given in the transcription here without abstracting them to their original alveolar nasal form /n/. The palatal nasal consonant also appears before other vowels, such as /a/ in /ɲaʔù/ 'to swallow', so it can definitely be considered a separate phoneme in the latter environment. (2) Reduction to affricates: The numeral 4 is rendered /əblì/ in Dvrù and /əbrì/ in Mvpang Dvngsar, but in this dialect the *b{l,r} cluster is reduced to the affricate /dʒ/ as /ədʒì/.

Rvmø̀l Rvwàng, a southern Dvrù dialect originally spoken north of Konglangpø, Putao District, Kachin State, Myanmar. It is geographically and linguistically transitional between western Dvngsar, Waqdvmkong (northern Mvtwàng), and Dvrù. Since at least the 1950s, many Rvmø̀l speakers have moved to Nokmong and to larger towns in Kachin State such as Putao and Myitkyina, and beyond. Data provided by Chømgunggang Dø and his daughter Chømgunggang Chang. The phonology of this dialect has not been fully analyzed yet. In general, however, this dialect has a similar phonemic system to Mvtwàng Rvwàng (R. Morse 1962/1963; S. Morse 1988, 1989) and Rvmø̀l Rvwàng (Straub 2016). There are three tones on syllables that do not have stop finals, based on a scale of 5 (highest) to 1 (lowest): High /á/ 55~53, Mid /a/ 33, Low /à/ 31~11. Tone on syllables with final p/t/k/ or ʔ (the latter considered a tone-register complex) is non-distinctive, usually realized as high or high falling. Tone on minor syllables (Cə) is non-distinctive as well. Vowels: i, e [e~ɛ], a, u, o [o~ɔ], ə, ɨ. Initial consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, s, z [dz], ts, tʃ, dʒ, m, n, ɲ, ŋ, h [h~x], j, l, r [ɹ~r~ɾ]. Voiceless stops and affricates are aspirated, although this is not indicated in the transcription for brevity's sake. Final consonants: p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, l, r, j. Diphthongs include /aj, əj, ɨj, uj, oj/. /ɨj/ is usually realized with a slightly longer vowel: [ɨˑj]; /aj/ may be considered an inherently-long-vowel counterpart to /əj/. Clusters observed include: /bl, pr, br, kr, gr/. The cluster /mj/ is found in Burmese loanwords, and the cluster /dw/ in Jinghpaw loanwords. In terms of phonological processes, two are observable here: (1) Palatalization: The initial consonant /n/ becomes /ɲ/ when followed by the vowel /i/, e.g. əní sə́l→əɲí sə́l 'twenty'. Although this nasal palatalization is a regular process, the palatal nasal forms are given in the transcription here without abstracting them to their original alveolar nasal form /n/. The palatal nasal consonant also appears before other vowels, such as /a/ in /ɲaʔù/ 'to swallow', so it can definitely be considered a separate phoneme in the latter environment. (2) Reduction to affricates: The numeral 4 is rendered /əblì/ in Dvrù and /əbrì/ in Mvpang Dvngsar, but in this dialect the *b{l,r} cluster is reduced to the affricate /dʒ/ as /ədʒì/.

There is almost no literature on the Sadu ethnic group. The historical background we acquired was mainly from oral narration delivered by the elders in the three hamlets. According to limited local Chinese records and some olders’ oral narrations, it was said that Li clan in Jiaoyuan and Bi clan in Dashuitang hamlet moved from Hetaoyuan Township in Kunyan County and Baofeng Township of Jinning County in the Qing Dynasty. Originally they belonged to a sub-branch of Yi who claimed to be “Samodu”, whose ancestors were referred to “Ximodi” in Tang Dynasty, and as “Ximotu” in Yuan Dynasty. This group of people was named as “Bailuoluo Samodu” after Ming Dynasty. Nowadays, the villagers of the Li clan acknowledge that they are the descendants of Dali Bai nationality, however. They call themselves Sadu. Yet they use different names to distinguish themselves from one hamlet to another. The people from Xincun village call themselves Suonapo. The people from Tashuitang call themselves Tatapo; The people from Jiaoyuan claimed themselves Lilepo. They all were referred as Bai-Yi before 1958. They were designated by the Government as Bai nationality in 1858. Nevertheless, the language is very unique. It is neither intelligible to Yinyuan Bai, nor Dali Bai, nor local Yi. Sadly, we found that the descendants of preceding generations in Hetaoyuan and Baofeng Townships now all have shifted Chinese. Therefore, this group of people was redefined as the Sadu. According the identification, the Sadu language belongs to one of the languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. However, the Sadu language is a lesser-known language. It is not intelligible to Bai, nor the neighboring Yi. It is necessary to redefine the genetic affiliation explicitly based on core words, phonology, words formation and grammar analysis as well as comparison with related language Yuxi Municipality is located in the middle of Yunnan Province, with a distance of 88 kilometers from Kunming city, the provincial capital. Yuxi Municipality, with a total area of 15,285 km², consists of one district and eight counties under its jurisdiction, namely, Hongta District, Tonghai County, Jiangchuan County, Chengjiang County, Huaning County, Yimen County, Eshan Yi Autonomous County, Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County and Yuanjiang Hani, Yi and Dai Autonomous County.

Western Dvngsar (Tangsar), Mvpáng clan. Originally spoken along the upper Renyinchi and Langdaqgong streams north of Konglangpø, Putao District, Kachin State, Myanmar. Collected from Mapáng Dù in Bangkok, Thailand. The phonology of this dialect has not been fully analyzed yet. In general, however, this dialect has a similar phonemic system to Mvtwàng Rvwàng (R. Morse 1962/1963; S. Morse 1988, 1989) and Rvmø̀l Rvwàng (Straub 2016). There are three tones on syllables that do not have stop finals, based on a scale of 5 (highest) to 1 (lowest): High /á/ 55~53, Mid /a/ 33, Low /à/ 31~11. Tone on syllables with final p/t/k/ or ʔ (the latter considered a tone-register complex) is non-distinctive, usually realized as high or high falling. Tone on minor syllables (Cə) is non-distinctive as well. Vowels: i, e [e~ɛ], a, u, o [o~ɔ], ə, ɨ. Initial consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, s, z [dz], ts, tʃ, dʒ, m, n, ɲ, ŋ, h [h~x], j, l, r [ɹ~r~ɾ]. Voiceless stops and affricates are aspirated, although this is not indicated in the transcription for brevity's sake. Final consonants: p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, l, r, j. Diphthongs include /aj, əj, ɨj, uj, oj/. /ɨj/ is usually realized with a slightly longer vowel: [ɨˑj]; /aj/ may be considered an inherently-long-vowel counterpart to /əj/. Clusters observed include: /bl, pr, br, kr, gr/. The cluster /mj/ is found in Burmese loanwords, and the cluster /dw/ in Jinghpaw loanwords. In terms of phonological processes, two are observable here: (1) Palatalization: The initial consonant /n/ becomes /ɲ/ when followed by the vowel /i/, e.g. əní sə́l→əɲí sə́l 'twenty'. Although this nasal palatalization is a regular process, the palatal nasal forms are given in the transcription here without abstracting them to their original alveolar nasal form /n/. The palatal nasal consonant also appears before other vowels, such as /a/ in /ɲaʔù/ 'to swallow', so it can definitely be considered a separate phoneme in the latter environment. (2) Reduction to affricates: The numeral 4 is rendered /əblì/ in Dvrù and /əbrì/ in Mvpang Dvngsar, but in this dialect the *b{l,r} cluster is reduced to the affricate /dʒ/ as /ədʒì/.

The three forms above are the only ones I found, and they only ever occurred with classifiers: -le, for the general classifier, and a few other marginal classifiers (-phe for round-ish objects, -lem for days.) All other numerals that I encountered were taken directly from Nepali (and used without classifiers). Thulung is in serious contact with Nepali, and very endangered as a result. When I was there, the youngest semi-speakers were in their twenties, and even these were exceptional. One other thing to bear in mind is that this is a small community, and the nearest market is in a zone where a number of minorities come together, so Nepali is used for any real numerical/monetary transaction. An anthropologist called Nicholas Allen did work on Thulung in the early 70's, and he too recorded an almost complete loss of the numeral system. Allen (p.102) says that ""No Thulung that I met knew how to count in Thulung beyond four (many could only reach three), with the exception of one or two individuals who had learnt AS' system from his book. It is in fact most unlikely that the higher numbers were ever in current use."" The AS system he is referring to is a system for counting up to 100, which Agam Sing Dewsa RAI put in a 1944 book about the Thulung language (written in Nepali). I wonder if Toba just cited that system? As for tones, Allen had found traces of tone in Thulung (it took him years to notice it, and it wasn't consistently applied by all speakers--also, he found that the great majority of the words in the language did not have tone), but I found that any tones there may have been were lost by the time I got there. Tone loss through contact is a documented pattern, and as Nepali has no tone, I think that younger speakers must have decided over time that any differences they heard in the few words older speakers made tone distinctions for were irrelevant... Anyway, I feel confident in saying no tone in current-day Thulung. As for Koyi, there are no earlier records, so who knows, but I didn't see evidence of tone when I was there. Interesting if you consider the difference between Thulung and Koyi—both communities of about the same sizes, yet Koyi has a productive (and used) numeral system, whereas Thulung has borrowed almost the entire system from Nepali.

The latter two literally translate as ‘one hand finger’ and ‘two hand finger’, although bryamci is the word general used for ‘finger’. Hodgson (1857: 341) lists the ‘Chouras’ya’ forms kolo ‘one’, nik’si ‘two’, súm’makha ‘three’ and phíbakha ‘four’. The ordinary numerals one to twelve are listed above. The native numeral kwalo ~ kwal ‘one’ is considered a nominal on morphosyntactic grounds. Numerals which are used as an argument take the markers required by Wambule grammar. Numerals usually precede other adnominal modifiers. The numeral kwalo ~ kwal ‘one’ is a very interesting form, since its ongoing use seems to be connected to the fact that this word does not only serve to indicate exactly one entity of a certain species, but is also be used as the equivalent of the English indefinite article a. The numeral kwalo ~ kwal ‘one’ can be analysed as a lexicalised combination of the bound morpheme <kwa·> ‘one’ plus the locative marker <·lo>.

The variety (of Zeme) spoken in Nagaland is slightly different and is referred to as Northern Zeme. Many people I met claimed these two varieties are not mutually intelligible.

The numerals from eleven to fifty nine are formed without taking any affixes by compounding the basic numerals from 1 to 9 to the numerals 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50. 60, 70, 80 and 90 are purely multiplication of ten with the basic numerals. Although, 'kereu' denote 'ten' in Zeme, it is not used to form multiplicative compound. Instead of it, 'riak' (denotes ten) is generally used along with basic numerals to form lower multiplicative compound. The multiplicative-cum-additive compound numerals are formed from 61 to 69, 71 to 79, 81 to 89 and 91 to 99 by adding 'ze' between the two basic numerals.
