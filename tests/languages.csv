abua1244-1,"Abuan, Nigeria",abua1244,,abn,,,,,Abua.htm,"Rev. Ian Gardner, Nigeria Bible Translation Trust, Nigeria, February 25, 2009. December 19, 2016.",,"Abuan has an old counting system which was unable to handle large numbers- 400 being the highest. The number one always behaves like a descriptive adjective; the numerals 2-9 are indeclinable. Any of these might be added to the numbers 20, 30, 40 and 60, with e.g. 79 becoming 60 +10 + 9. 80 and numbers up to 400 and beyond all involved both multiplication and addition always using 20 or 400 as the basic e. g. 119 was 5 times 20 + 10+ 9; 519 was 400 + 5 times 20 plus ten plus 9. The system is now in the process of being changed to multiples of 10, 100, 1000 which of course suits the modern world much better. The notation will need to be reinterpreted first into the Abuan orthography, then into IPA. The symbol [ before b, d, a, e, i, o, u means that each of these letters has a subscript dot in the orthography; this subscript dot is an implosive marker in the case of the consonants and a concord marker in the case of the vowels. A dotted vowel in the orthography indicates that all preceding vowels in the word are also dotted (lax vowels). Absence of subscript dot under a vowel means that that vowel is a tense vowel. We have 10 vowels in Abuan and two kinds of b and d, implosive and explosive."
